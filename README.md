# Deep Learning Project: Asteroid Clone Agent

This repository hosts an Asteroids game clone powered by a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent, created using Python, Pygame, and TensorFlow. The project aims to demonstrate the application of deep reinforcement learning in controlling the player's spacecraft to avoid and destroy asteroids.

## Overview
The game environment is built using Pygame, where the player controls a spaceship to navigate through a field of asteroids. The primary objective is to avoid collisions while destroying asteroids using bullets. The player's actions include moving forward, rotating left, right, and shooting. The DQN agent, implemented using TensorFlow, learns to play the game by interacting with the environment, receiving rewards based on its actions.
